  - The term ‘megacity’ refers to metropolitan areas with a total population of more than 10 million people. 
  - Whereas only 3% of the global population lived in cities in 1800, by the end of the 20th century that figure had risen to 47%. This figure is predicted to rise to more than 70% by the second half of the 21st century, a number made even more startling by the fact that the human population is expected to have increased by two billion by that point.
  - In contrast, contemporary megacity development is predominantly focused in areas of the world that are the least developed, such as Mumbai.
  - In 1950, the only megacities were New York-Newark and Tokyo. By 1995 the number had risen to 14. In 2020, there were 34.
